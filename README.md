## Initial start
- To start, you must have Visual Code 2022, as it is the current only project file Projuicer from JUCE can make.
- You need the **Desktop Development with C++** workload to start coding.
- For tutorials, check out *https://juce.com/learn/tutorials/*.
- The project file is located at ***".../GUI/Builds/VisualStudio2022/GUI.sln"***.
- **NOTE**: To be able to commit, do not include any files in ***".../GUI/Builds/VisualStudio2022/.vs/..."*** and ***".../GUI/Builds/VisualStudio2022/x64/..."***, as it is the resulting application after compiling. (Already dealt with gitignore.)

## Expected knowledge to be used
- Every single thing in the JUCE tutorial section, so good luck y'all.
- Currently need Graphics tutorial for current to-do
