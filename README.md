# Audio Enhancing Project
This is a project with the vision of making a program with audio enhancing capabilities.
This will be application based, where it can be used on Windows or Android (Windows take priority).


### Features to be had
- Speech Enhancement
- Noise Filtering and Reduction

## Initial start
- To start, you must have Visual Code 2022, as it is the current only project file Projuicer from JUCE can make.
- The project file is located at ***".../GUI/Builds/VisualStudio2022/GUI.sln"***
- **NOTE**: To be able to commit, do not include any files in ***".../GUI/Builds/VisualStudio2022/.vs/..."*** and ***".../GUI/Builds/VisualStudio2022/x64/..."***, as it is the resulting application after compiling.
